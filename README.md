# Movie-Watchlist
 A simple movie watchlist webapp where user can register/sign in and add movies to their watchlist along with key information and give it a rating /5.


 Future todo:
 Try to pull data from imdb or elsewhere based on the Title and year of the movie.
 Add review field for user review for movies and be able to display them for all users (registered or not) to view. (similar to microblog)
